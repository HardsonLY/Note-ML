# Note-ML
Machine Learning Basic study note
It's just my study note. Maybe you will need it. Hope it can help you!

The "MachineLearning_Basic.md" is just a review about ML, it's a good file to make you know the ML's environment quickly. If you are good at ML, skip it.

The "python-AI.md" is my study note about python, but also very basic.

The notes will be keeping updating.
